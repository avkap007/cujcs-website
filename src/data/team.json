    "description": "The Canadian Undergraduate Journal of Cognitive Science (CUJCS) is an electronic and print journal published by the Cognitive Science Student Society (CSÂ³) at Simon Fraser University.",
    "aim": "Our aim is to provide a forum for students to share work among peers and gain valuable experience in the process of getting an academic paper published. As a publication, CUJCS provides a unique reference for students, showcases research by undergraduate students, improves the contact and exchange of ideas between Canadian students and cognitive scientists alike, and illustrates the interdisciplinary work that is the hallmark of cognitive science. Although preference is given to Canadian students, contributions from students elsewhere are strongly encouraged."
